        <p>
            The TECH area is a section that gives out info on the best accomodations
            for gaming. I'm not exactly sure how to work this section, as none of the
            navbar links work. (Except for the home option) I will try to make some changes
            to this web page by working some of the navbar links and hopefully later in the
            years. Thanks for reading!
